# Practice

You're going to create a component named after yourself (e.g. `<Thomas />`, or `<Evelyn />` or `<Priya />`). It should contain the following information.

1. Your full name
1. Your cohort
1. Your home address
1. The make and model of your favorite vehicle
1. The name, and species/breed of your favorite, or ideal, pet

Make sure you author components for each unique object being represented and compose them into the component named after you.

## Advanced Practice

You're going to update your application that represents you to use state and props. Previously, you hard-coded the following information into your components.

1. Your full name
1. Your cohort
1. Your home address
1. The make and model of your favorite vehicle
1. The name, and species/breed of your favorite, or ideal, pet

Now you need to pull all of that data that is scattered across your component files, and give your personal component an initial state with appropriate properties.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import Home from "./Home"  // Import the Home component


class Me extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        super(props)

        // Put all information about yourself as state properties
        this.state = {
            firstName: "Rachel",
            lastName: "Morgan"
        }
    }

    // Update your JSX to use state properties
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h3>{this.state.firstName} ${this.state.lastName}</h3>
                <h4>Evening Cohort 1</h4>
                <h5>Nashville Software School</h5>
                <Home />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Me
```

Now, pass the state values from your personal component to each of its children, and use those props in the children components.


## Challenge

Now it's time to take your personal data and expose it through an API with `json-server`. Create a `personal.json` file in your project with a `people` collection. Put your information in that collection.

```json
{
    "people": [
        {
            // Your properties go here
        }
    ]
}
```

Start your API with the following command.

```sh
json-server -p 8080 -w personal.json
```

Update your personal component to retrieve the information from the API, and when it is received, update the state of your component.

## Challenge Part 2

Create multiple collections in your API.

1. Bio info (name and address)
1. Car information
1. Pet information

Use foreign keys to assign cars and pets to a person.

Once that's done, update your `componentDidMount` function to load all the related data, and use `setState` when each response comes back.

# NavBar Challenge

Create a navigation bar for your application with three links in it.

1. Home
1. Projects
1. About Me

The home page should display the following information.

1. Your name
1. List of technologies you've learned so far

The projects page should list the name and a link to the repo for each group project that you've worked on so far.

The about me page should display any other interesting information about yourself that you want others to know.

1. Favorite frogs
1. Places you've traveled
1. Comic book collection

etc...
